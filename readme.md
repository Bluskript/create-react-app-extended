# Create React Bundle

### An NPM package designed to make react app creation even faster

#### Note : This is currently in very early development and some things might not work or not up to standards. If you see an issue with the way files are structured or something isn't working, open a GitHub issue.

### WARNING : Nothing works quite yet, I am mainly using this for version tracking as of now. This message will disappear when it's usable.

`npm i -g create-react-bundle`
`create-react-bundle`
